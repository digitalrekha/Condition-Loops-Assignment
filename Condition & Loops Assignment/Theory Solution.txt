Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.
Ans: Conditional statements are the building blocks of decision-making in programming. They allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions being true or false. This enables you to write code that adapts to different situations and reacts accordingly.
Syntex: 
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if the condition is false 
}

Example: 
let score = 80;

if (score > 70) {
  console.log("You passed the exam!");
} else {
  console.log("You need to work harder next time.");
}

Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.
Ans: Loops are one of the fundamental building blocks of programming. They allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.

Why do we need loops?

-Automation: Loops save you time and effort by automating repetitive tasks. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can put it inside a loop and let the computer do the heavy lifting.

-Data processing: Loops are essential for iterating through collections of data, like lists or arrays, and performing operations on each element.

-Algorithms: Many algorithms rely on loops to perform calculations or simulations repeatedly. 

Types of Loops and their Syntax:

1. For Loop: The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance.

Syntax: for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}

Example: for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

2. While loop: The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop continues as long as the specified condition is true.

Syntax: while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}

Example: let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

3. Do-while loop: It is similar to the while loop, the do-while loop executes the block of code at least once, and then it continues to execute as long as the specified condition is true.

Syntax: do {
    // code to be repeated
} while (condition);

Example: let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
